# keyloger_project by Ravi_shankar_lawaniya

Creating a keylogger in Python to record keystrokes surreptitiously is potentially illegal and unethical. However, for educational purposes, here's a brief outline of how it's done:

Module Import: Import the pynput module to monitor keyboard input.

Listener Creation: Use pynput.keyboard to create a listener, triggering a callback function for each key press.

Capture and Storage: In the callback, capture keystrokes and store them, possibly with timestamps and additional context.

Execution: Start the listener to record keystrokes, optionally running it in the background or hidden.

Advanced Features (optional): Add features like email sending or data encryption for security.
