# keyloger_project by Ravi_shankar_lawaniya

A keylogger is software or hardware that secretly records keystrokes on a computer. Creating a basic Python keylogger involves: 

1. Import Modules: Import the pynput module to monitor keyboards.

2. Listener: Use pynput.keyboard to create a listener with a callback for key presses.

3. Capture and Store: In the callback, capture and store keys, possibly with timestamps and context.

4. Run Keylogger: Start the listener, potentially as a hidden background process.

5. Optional Enhancements: Add features like email sending or data encryption.
